This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Using the screenshot below as a guide build a React application with the following functionality:

Provide a search form to allow users to search for books by some search term that they enter.
Allow filters such as type of book or whether the book is a free ebook or not.
Display the search result in list and optionally allow the user to click a result to see further details of the book.
Use the Google Books API to perform the search
